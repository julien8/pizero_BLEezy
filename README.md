# Bleezy: Raspberry Pi Zero BLE Module #

Using the nRF52188 a very interesting BLE solution for the Raspberry Pi is realized. The Raspberry Pi allows you to use OpenOCD to program the nRF chips ARM M0 core. This opens up potentioal for a variety of applications where Bluetooth can be used to monitor and control the state of the Raspberry Pi.
